## Description
The target audience of the application is a wide range of people who want to optimize the uniform distribution of costs between the company of people.

People share a very large part of their expenses. Whether itâ€™s a joint trip to a restaurant, a cinema, a store or any place where payment should be divided into two or more people. In each of these situations, it is almost always easier to pay someone alone, so as not to be distracted by calculating the amount and collecting funds from each person. In addition, quite often a situation arises when someone will not be able to make their part of the payment or there will not be enough money.
In this case, after making the payment by one person, each of the rest of the company will owe him a certain amount of funds. Because of this, you will have to save a receipt for payment, memorize or write down details, make a calculation. We will have to remind everyone of his duty and, to be honest, to explain where the amount received came from.
A situation may also arise when payment was made not by one person for all, but several. At the same time, everyone contributed a different amount of funds. In this case, the correct distribution of debts will be even more difficult. And the likelihood that any detail in the calculation will be missed greatly increases.
